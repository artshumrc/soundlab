# Mixtape Creator

A web experience for Harvard Sound Lab. Using WebRTC and Web Audio APIs, the experience captures and mixes sound input into a WAV file for folks to download.

## Getting Started

This is a Svelte app, built with Rollup. To install dependencies, we recommend using Yarn, but NPM will also work.

```sh
yarn install
```

## Development

Start a development server (which supprots hot reloading) using:

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Deployment

Export a static build to the `public/` directory using:

```sh
yarn build
```

Then, the output `public/` directory can be hosted as you wish. Images, CSS, JS bundles, and other artifacts should already be configured to work when hosted from any path.
